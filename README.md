# Credits
[localip](https://github.com/localip) for the original idea, coming from their [Modern Indicators](https://github.com/discord-modifications/modern-indicators).

[FeroshUX](https://github.com/FeroshUX) for fixing the weird padding that appeared above `Active Threads`. This fix was originally done on [Tachi-Cord](https://github.com/LuckFire/tachi-cord), so I had to move it over to the main repo.
